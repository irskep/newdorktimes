      <h1>Origins</h1>

      <p>
        The New Dork Times was written circa 1997 by two 8-year-old boys named
        Eric Drury and Stephen Johnson. Its exact dates and frequency are long
        lost to the chasms of time, but its biting social commentary is as
        relevant as ever.

      <p>
        The authors have long lost contact with each othe with each other. This
        archive was retrieved from a dusty box filled with disintegrating
        newsprint and stray LEGO blocks.

      <h1>Digital Archive</h1>

      <p>
        The digital archive you are reading now was completed over <em>slightly
        more than two hours</em> of painstaking work. Each salvageable page
        of the original newsprint was scanned with a cheap document scanner,
        preserving the original defects of the medium seen in the
        forward-looking, media-heavy, apocalyptic <a href="../#issue-9">Issue
          9</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The text of each issue was extracted with advanced "Optical Character
        Recognition" technology and tweaked by hand to remove errors. <a
          href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown">Markdown</a>
        directives were also added. The Markdown file was converted to HTML and
        inserted into a simple template with no further programmatic
        modification.
      </p>

      <p>
        The resulting DOM tree was minimally styled with CSS, letting your web
        browser's gorgeous default settings shine through. It was also made
        interactive with cutting-edge Javascript know-how and elbow grease.
