the bad guys it could find instead. Stupidman received a 1,000 year vacation in
Hawaii.</p>

<p>Today, in the Drury home, 4 cars raced to see which car would go the farthest.
Here are the cars in the order that they turned out.</p>
<h3 id="1stall-terrain-arson">1st:All-Terrain Arson</h3>
<p>A fast model, All-Terrain Arson came in first. Because it's wheels stick out
over the top, it wouldn't have mattered if it had flipped over.</p>
<h3 id="2ndradar-rover">2nd:Radar Rover</h3>
<p>When its wheels turn, gears turn, activating a powerful radar.</p>
<h3 id="3rdexploding-buggy">3rd:Exploding Buggy</h3>
<p>When it hits a large bump, its seat ejects, just for safety.</p>
<h3 id="4th-flipper">4th: Flipper</h3>
<p>When it drives, a long front part bends over and lands on the ground which
causes the stupid car to flip over and break itself.</p>

<p>Just yesterday, at about 5 p.m., the world's second largest stink bomb hit
Washington D.C. They didn't catch the pilot, but they got his license plate
number and a picture of him, shown here:</p>
<p><img alt="Nutty Cracker" src="images/nutty_cracker.png" /></p>
<p>It was easy to identify him. He was our good friend Nutty
Cracker. Now he's in jail again.</p>

<p>Just yesterday, a savage war broke out in Alabama. It concerned two kids
fighting over a coconut shell. They couldn't solve the problem, so they went to
war. The kids who wanted the coconut shell were 5th grader named Freddy
Slacker and a puny 4th grader named Allison Froder. The war still goes on to
this very moment, but I am on the scene right now and am about to get blown up
by a 4th grade stink bomb, so I gotta go.</p>
