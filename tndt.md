## Favorite Sayings Of The Week

Throwbots are :'( with :-)

Stephen has his :-&.

Eric is :-(.

Captain Underpants can't stop :-0.

## The Hero Section

**Stupidman:** He may have come from another planet, but his intelligence is
definitely not superior

**Captain Underpants:** When some principal hears fingers snapping, he turns
into the incredible Captain Underpants.

**Super Stag Beetle Guy:** This is, by far, the strangest super hero ever to
exist. His super power is to trap bad guys with his spiked gloves.

## The Bad Guy Section

**Dead Burglar:** He is the arch enemy of Stupidman.

**Praying Mantis Man:** He is the arch enemy of Super Stag Beetle Guy. He eats people.

## The Sidekick Section

**Mole Cricket Girl:** Being Super Stag Beetle Guy's sidekick, her job is to
call 911 and hit bad guys with her shovel.

## Super Robot Created!!!

Not recently ago, a bad guy created a robot armed with a Fissinger, which is a
laser that can destroy anything. Although he created the robot for evil, a
virus caused the robot (whose name is Herman Melville) to use its laser on all
the bad guys it could find instead. Stupidman received a 1,000 year vacation in
Hawaii.

## The Donson 500 Takes Place

Today, in the Drury home, 4 cars raced to see which car would go the farthest.
Here are the cars in the order that they turned out.

### 1st:All-Terrain Arson

A fast model, All-Terrain Arson came in first. Because it's wheels stick out
over the top, it wouldn't have mattered if it had flipped over.

### 2nd:Radar Rover

When its wheels turn, gears turn, activating a powerful radar.

### 3rd:Exploding Buggy

When it hits a large bump, its seat ejects, just for safety.

### 4th: Flipper

When it drives, a long front part bends over and lands on the ground which
causes the stupid car to flip over and break itself.

## The Throwbot Section

This section requires tossing Throwbots into the air and seeing where they land on the keyboard. Here goes!

## Big Stink Bomb Hits Washington D.C.

Just yesterday, at about 5 p.m., the world's second largest stink bomb hit
Washington D.C. They didn't catch the pilot, but they got his license plate
number and a picture of him, shown here:

It was easy to identify him. He was our good friend Nutty
Cracker. Now he's in jail again.

## War Breaks Out In Alabama

Just yesterday, a savage war broke out in Alabama. It concerned two kids
fighting over a coconut shell. They couldn't solve the problem, so they went to
war. The kids who wanted the coconut shell were 5th grader named Freddy
Slacker and a puny 4th grader named Allison Froder. The war still goes on to
this very moment, but I am on the scene right now and am about to get blown up
by a 4th grade stink bomb, so I gotta go.
